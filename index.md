### Projects

---
> [Object Detection and Tracking](https://launchlab.ai/rd-program/)
Working to train a model to identify the workout type performed by user and correct them in real-time for Home fitness program.<br/>
Brainstormed on finding the right dataset and deciding on different activity recognition approaches.<br/>

> [Machine Learning](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
Dataset from different sources are given to us, and we performed supervised learning on labelled data to predict the output of future inputs.<br/>
The course project involves collecting and preparing datasets for training supervised learning algorithms(Classification and Regression models).<br/>
Pipeline used: 
![Test Image 1](https://github.com/shabnm/shabnm.github.io/blob/master/images/pipeline_ML.PNG?raw=true)
Performing hyperparameter search(shown below are classification models only), evaluating (using F1 score, precision, recall, RMSE, r2 score) and summarizing performance by generating plots.<br/>
![Test Image 2](https://github.com/shabnm/shabnm.github.io/blob/master/images/hyperparameter_tuning.PNG?raw=true)
Loading and training a CNN using PyTorch to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.<br/>
We build 2 model, basic(Model1) and advance(Model2)<br/>
![Model1](https://github.com/shabnm/shabnm.github.io/blob/master/images/cnn1.PNG?raw=true)
![Model2](https://github.com/shabnm/shabnm.github.io/blob/master/images/cnn2.PNG?raw=true)
Results obtained are:

> [ImplementAI Hackathon](https://github.com/shabnm/CAE_Shabnam)
CAE has collected data during the training session of pilots and their responses of being flagged or not. Based on pre-labelled data, we train a model to flag pilot.<br/> accurately on future training sessions of pilot.<br/>

> [Artificial Intelligence]
Teaming with a classmate to build an efficient adversarial search algorithm to play the game Double Card. We implemented minimax and alpha beta pruning along with our heuristics, to optimize the search. Our AI beat 85% of the students during the class tournament.
The 2nd project includes building a Spam\Ham classifier using  Naive-Bayes classifier to sort emails into SPAM and HAM classes. We started by cleaning the document by removing stop words, removing most and least frequent words, stemming and then creating the inverted index and performing the classification. Confusion matrix was used to see the result.

> [Image Processing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ztNmtf_HhKcqMISRH7HKKMaUdcEDHvofDtEh22I2IaU/edit?usp=sharing)
Collaborated with 2 undergraduate students to reproduce the research paper written by Reza Zahiri, "Motion Estimation in Ultrasound Images Using TDPE", using MATLAB.
TDPE is an improvement of the TDE approach, used to measure displacement of tissue in elastography images under compression  to infer its elastic property.
Detailed report is here(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1emDLXIsyWqPVcunZluO8D8KlDFiAus26t5_x1LU0mBM/edit?usp=sharing)

> [Information Retrieval and Web Search using Web Crawling & aFinn sentiment analysis]()
Build a web search engine, which displays the top 10 most relevant URLs to the user ,based on the cosine similarity and the aFinn score(sentiment analysis).  
Implemented Boolean retrieval and Ranked retrieval model, on the inverted index, formed using SPIMI algorithm ,using Python and its library NLTK and BeautifulSoup.

> [Comparative study of programming language]()
3 Individual projects were given in 3 different languages, namely python, clojure and erlang in a very short duration. With my strong learning skills, I learnt clojure and erlang from scratch and built the project efficiently in the time frame.
